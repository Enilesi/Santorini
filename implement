//            the function is valid building doesnt work properly!!!!! i build even if my worker is not next to the possible building



no more moves=>

-no worker has no free space for building:
    -aka no more domes, level1, level2, level3 in the adjiacent place
-can't jump anymore
    -aka sourounded by domes or other workers
-can't climp on a building anymore =>
    -too high or domes/workers
-


//                    if worker on 1 3  (no building) i can put dome on 1 3=> WRONG!!!; must check 



for worker coord i must do sth becase for not int char=> segmentation fault  (and not only for that)
